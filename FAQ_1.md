#Reflect: Manual Commits
**_By committing manually instead of automatically, you can decide what to commit and when._**

**_This gives the opportunity to split the commits based on functionality._**

**_By committing manually you can specify commit messages describing what has changed, instead of only showing an auto commit._**

#Reflect: Multi-File commits
**_Multi-file commits are usefull when files are related to eachother._**

**_"Normal" documents seldom have relations, so those are not needed. In sourcecode, files will have lots of relations._**

**_So having multi-file commits is an essential feature._**
