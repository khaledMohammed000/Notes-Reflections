1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans- a) for making mutiple copies of the project
     b) for collabrating with others
     c) for sharing the project
     d) show off your work 

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans- u will make unwanted updates to ur master branch in the local if Git automatically updated all the commits by pulling them....one more point to consider is there may be changes in Github repository which are still transitional and need lot more commits for the project to get stable...u wanna avoid all the buggy commits ...wouldnt u ???

3)Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Ans- forks are used when u wanna make changes to a existing repository on Github but u dont have the permissions to do so
	 clones are used to make a copy of a repository from Github onto ur machine Locally
	 branches are part of a repository...u could consider them as a chunk of commits branching from the main branch of commits...

4)What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Ans- u would optimize in sending only those commits to ur remote that are needed...also could be used to compare both remote and local...like how ahead the are and such....

5)How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Ans- I dont know....Google Drive appears to be a good option but i dont know if it as powerful as git or not...plus Git Hub has all the facilitites u could use to do collaboration....then y something else ???
